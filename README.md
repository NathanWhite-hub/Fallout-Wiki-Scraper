# Fallout-Wiki-Scraper
This is a personal project I created using Python and the Playwright framework to scrape webdata from the Fallout Wiki.

In order to get comfortable with Playwright amazing features for automating naviating webpages, I started this project to collect data to be used in NovelAI for writers.
